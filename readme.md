Full-Stack Roulette Application
This is a full-stack game that allows the user to choose an image that they think the spinner will land on and attempt to stop the spinner on that image.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node-JS, MongoDB, Express and Passport

The objective of this project was to create an app on the frontend that users will be able to play but that had a backend that kept track of the total wins and losses so the casino owner would know if they needed to make the game more difficulty based on the amount of times people were winning.

Optimization
I would like to add to the design and add an actual spinner instead of an the way I currently have the app randomly going through the images.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to incorporate the front end from the back but also keep seperate them. This will be crucial wherever I work. The game only allows the user to play and the user can't do anything to the backend, but the backend at the same time is still keeping track of data which for a business can be losses or earnings and can really help a business analyze what needs to be changed and what's working.
